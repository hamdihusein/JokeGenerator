# Joke Generator Project

This is a simple web-based joke generator that utilizes HTML, CSS, an external API, and JavaScript to provide users with a random joke each time they click a button. Feel free to use this at the end of a long work day with your family, friends, and even young folks (suitable for kids over the age of 10).
